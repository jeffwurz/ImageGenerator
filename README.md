# ImageGenerator
ImageGenerator

  Intention is to use SVG (scalable vector graphics) to programatically generate many iterations around a theme and many color combinations.
  Then a human will determine the value of each. 
  (could use a machine learning algorithm to learn what is preferred output and use that later to sort more complex images.)
  
  SVG-> PNG in Perl

Todo functionality:
  Fill, fill another shape with other small shapes
  
  rotate, rotation for a shape
  
  random, random selection of some element.
  
  concentric, create concentric shapes with different dimensions
  
  picture in picture, already genereated pictures used as elements in another.
