# ImageGenerator
ImageGenerator

  Intention is to use SVG (scalable vector graphics) to programmatically generate many iterations around a theme and many color combinations.

  Then a human will determine the value of each.

  (could use a machine learning algorithm to learn what is preferred output and use that later to sort more complex images.)


  SVG-> PNG in Perl


Todo functionality:

  Fill :  fill another shape with other small shapes

  Rotate : rotation for a shape

  Random : random selection of some element.

  Concentric : create concentric shapes with different dimensions

  Picture in Picture : already genereated pictures used as elements in another.

  Dependencies:
    Inkscape - convert to png.
