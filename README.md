# ImageGenerator
    Intention is to use SVG (scalable vector graphics) to programmatically generate many iterations around a theme and many color combinations.
        SVG -> PNG in Perl

    First : first attempt, randomizes pitch calculation

    Concentric : create concentric shapes with different dimensions

    Fill Frame: fill grid with geometries, then do concentric.

Todo functionality:

    Fill :  fill another shape with other small shapes

    Rotate : rotation for a shape

    Randomizer : randomize selection of any element.

    Picture in Picture : already generated pictures used as elements in another.

    Dependencies:

        Inkscape - convert to png.

        (not in scope) Then (outside of program) a human will determine the value of each.
            -could use a machine learning algorithm to learn what is preferred output and use that later to sort more complex images.)
