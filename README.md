# ImageGenerator
ImageGenerator

  Intention is to use SVG (scalable vector graphics) to programatically generate many iterations around a theme and many color combinations.
  Then a human will determine the value of each. 
  (could use a machine learning algorithm to learn what is preferred output and use that later to sort more complex images.)
